            John Stephen K. Fajardo was born on November 30, 2004, as the eldest of three siblings.<sup>1</sup> He grew up in Santa Maria, Bulacan, 
            in a simple yet loving family.<sup>2</sup> Without a room of his own, he shared a bed with his family, which strengthened their bond.<sup>3</sup> He attended 
            Cebu Sacred Heart College for his elementary years, where he consistently performed as an honor student.<sup>4</sup> Many people saw him as
            a bright child because of his academic achievements.<sup>5</sup> However, he was a shy kid around strangers but quite playful at home.<sup>6</sup> 
            His family often found him to be a bit of a nuisance, always joking around and making noise.<sup>7</sup> Despite his playful nature, he was
            well-mannered and disciplined, thanks to the values instilled in him by his parents.<sup>8</sup> One of his favorite childhood activities was playing 
            outdoors with friends.<sup>9</sup> He spent hours running around, climbing trees, and engaging in various games.<sup>10</sup> Like many children, he had a few childhood 
            crushes that made his early years more exciting.<sup>11</sup> However, what truly captured his heart was basketball.<sup>12</sup> He developed a deep love for the sport at
            an early age and played whenever he had the chance.<sup>13</sup> Whether practicing alone or playing with friends, he always felt happiest with a basketball 
            in his hands.<sup>14</sup> His family supported his passion while ensuring that he remained focused on his studies.<sup>15</sup> He admired his parents for their 
            hard work and sacrifices to provide for the family.<sup>16</sup> Their dedication inspired him to excel in school and make them proud.<sup>17</sup> He also enjoyed 
            family gatherings, where they bonded over simple meals and laughter.<sup>18</sup> Despite the challenges of life, his childhood was filled with warmth, 
            happiness, and valuable lessons.<sup>19</sup> Looking back, he remains grateful for the memories, experiences, and love that shaped his early years.<sup>20</sup>

                His teenage years were a period of transformation, challenges, and unforgettable experiences.<sup>1</sup>  
                At the age of 13, he underwent a significant milestone when he got circumcised, marking his transition into adolescence.<sup>2</sup>  
                Puberty came gradually, but by the 9th grade, he experienced a sudden growth spurt that made him almost unrecognizable.<sup>3</sup>  
                Before entering high school, he had to leave Cebu Sacred Heart College due to financial reasons.<sup>4</sup>  
                As a result, he attended three different high schools, which proved to be a difficult adjustment.<sup>5</sup>  
                In 9th grade, he transferred to Mater Dei Academy, where he met new friends and reconnected with old classmates from elementary school.<sup>6</sup>  
                Some of the people he met there became lifelong friends whom he now considers family.<sup>7</sup>  
                During these years, he experienced his first love, which was both exciting and overwhelming.<sup>8</sup>  
                However, his teenage years also brought his first major heartbreak, which was difficult to overcome.<sup>9</sup>  
                Despite this, he found comfort in his high school friends, who were always there to support him.<sup>10</sup>  
                They would often go out after class, creating lasting memories together.<sup>11</sup>  
                Basketball remained an essential part of his life, and he continued to play regularly, even participating in mini-leagues.<sup>12</sup>  
                However, everything changed when the pandemic struck, forcing him to stay home and isolate from his friends.<sup>13</sup>  
                During lockdown, he spent most of his days watching TV, playing video games, or endlessly scrolling through his phone.<sup>14</sup>  
                It was a difficult period, but he eventually adapted to the situation.<sup>15</sup>  
                After the pandemic, he was able to reunite with his friends and make up for the lost time.<sup>16</sup>  
                As high school came to an end, he and his peers faced the stress of college admissions.<sup>17</sup>  
                They spent countless hours discussing their future and contemplating which universities to apply to.<sup>18</sup>  
                Despite the struggles, he cherished every moment of his teenage years.<sup>19</sup>  
                Looking back, those years were a mixture of growth, heartache, and happiness.<sup>20</sup>

            Entering college in 2023 was a major transition that made him realize he was no longer a high school student.<sup>1</sup>  
            In senior high, he took the HUMSS strand and was initially unsure about which program to pursue in college.<sup>2</sup>  
            After careful consideration, he decided to take a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the University of the East (UE)-Manila.<sup>3</sup>  
            Choosing a college was a challenging decision, but having multiple family members as UE alumni greatly influenced his choice.<sup>4</sup>  
            He understood that this was the start of real life and that college would serve as the foundation for his future.<sup>5</sup>  
            Adjusting to this new phase was not easy, as he deeply missed his high school friends and the familiar environment he once had.<sup>6</sup>  
            However, it also opened up opportunities to meet new people who shared similar interests.<sup>7</sup>  
            One of his biggest struggles was the daily two-hour commute from Bulacan to Manila, which was both exhausting and time-consuming.<sup>8</sup>  
            Academically, he struggled with computer programming at first but gradually improved and became more proficient.<sup>9</sup>  
            When his second year started, he found it even harder to manage his time due to longer school hours.<sup>10</sup>  
            He had to sacrifice a lot of sleep just to keep up with his academic workload.<sup>11</sup>  
            As semesters passed, he began losing touch with some friends due to different circumstances.<sup>12</sup>  
            He also barely had the chance to see his hometown friends and high school family, making him feel increasingly disconnected.<sup>13</sup>  
            Basketball, which was once a big part of his life, became something he could only enjoy during semestral breaks.<sup>14</sup>  
            Despite these challenges, he gained his first work experience before the second semester of his second year as an assistant or encoder.<sup>15</sup>  
            This opportunity gave him valuable insights into the professional world and helped him develop new skills.<sup>16</sup>  
            While college life has been tough, it has also taught him resilience and independence.<sup>17</sup>  
            He is determined to finish his studies on time to help relieve his parents of financial burdens.<sup>18</sup>  
            Though the road ahead is uncertain, he remains motivated to push forward and make the most out of his college years.<sup>19</sup>  
            Every challenge he faces now is just a stepping stone toward the future he is working hard to build.<sup>20</sup>
